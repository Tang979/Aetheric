# Modernizing Mobile Game Backend with AWS Cloud Services

## Overview

In this workshop, our team presents the process of integrating core AWS services into a tower defense mobile game project developed on the Unity 6 platform. Since **Unity 6 has discontinued official support for the AWS SDK**, we've built the entire backend architecture following a **serverless** approach and implemented communication with AWS services through **REST APIs** signed with **AWS Signature Version 4** or authenticated with **JWT from Amazon Cognito**.

Configuration and integration are performed in separate functional blocks, ensuring the system is secure, scalable, and easy to test independently. The entire deployment process is designed with a practical approach â€“ prioritizing efficiency and simplicity while still adhering to AWS Well-Architected Framework principles.

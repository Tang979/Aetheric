## Introduction

Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an ideal cloud storage solution for managing and distributing dynamic assets for mobile games developed with Unity. Loading dynamic assets helps reduce the initial size of the game, improves loading times, and allows content updates without releasing new versions.

## Workshop Overview

In this workshop, we will learn:

1. [How to set up an S3 bucket to store game assets](4.1-CreateS3/)
2. [Integrating dynamic asset loading into Unity games](4.2-S3Unity/)
